# Important Notes
The implementation of the provided API has not been completed because the API class structure differed from the components structure
already implemented in the previous steps of the website and there was no time left to make all the necessary adjustments (the API access has been provided late).<br>
In addition to that, the API endpoints have some bugs that affected the main functionality of the website (creation of a user, deletion of a course...).<br>
For reference, the API bugs have been reported by email as soon as they have been encountered.<br>
Where possible, the connection to the API has been implemented and, even though the functionality is not complete for the reasons above, it shows the ability of using such technology.
